# Why TeenSpace?
Most teens are only reminded about safety regarding the aforementioned topics through school assemblies that hardly last an hour long. In addition, teens often find these assemblies boring and don't take them seriously. Even worse, these school assemblies usually only happen once a year, so teens aren't regularly reminded of what they should do. 

Constant reminders of safety ensure that teenagers are aware of how to protect themselves if they're faced with dangerous situations. Games can be opened anywhere, anytime – and they're fun and engaging. TeenSpace is a trivia-style game that reminds teens of safety procedures, providing specific scenarios so teens know exactly what to do rather than have a vague gist. The Spaces that teens can explore include active shooter safety, cybersafety, driving safety, drug safety, and dating safety.
